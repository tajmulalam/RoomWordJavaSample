# RoomWordJavaSample

In sample app i learned how to design and construct an app using the Architecture Components Room, ViewModel, and LiveData, and build an app that does the following:

Implements of Android Architecture Components.
Works with a database to get and save the data
Displays all the words in a RecyclerView in MainActivity.
Opens a second activity when the user taps the + button. When the user enters a word, adds the word to the database and the list.
The app is no-frills, but sufficiently complex which i can use it as a template to build other apps.
